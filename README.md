
# ETHWarsaw Hackathon 2022 -- Hack House

This is the official ETHWarsaw Hackathon 2022 submission for our project Hack House ðŸŒˆ. 

## Project Description 

Hack House is a Decentralized platform for booking accommodation together with your Web3 friends. We solve the issues of high cost and finding roommates. Anybody can add a book offer. Then offer is available for other people to join.  Every user that joins an offer and pays receives an NFT, generated using offers main picture. NFTs will serve as tickets to the accommodation.
Funds are held on smart contract until either all spots are filled or the offer expires.
When all spots are filled offer gets fulfilled. In case of expiring, funds are safely returned to users.  

## How it Works

1. Create an offer or join an existing one.
2. Pay for your spot.
3. Receive an NFT - ticket for your stay.  

## What's next for Hack House ? 

We are planning to add many features such as : 
- Hacker Validation - we'll check if you're a hacker before allowing you to create or join offers. We'll check if you have NFT Hackaton Ticket in your wallet.
- Profile Page - page containing your past, future and present stays data.
